            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rajasthan’s textiles are often perceived through the lens of tourism — colourful dupattas in markets, boutique block prints, and fashion-forward bandhani scarves. But behind this market image lies a much deeper, everyday textile culture that shapes the rhythms of home life across villages and small towns. In these spaces, textiles are not luxuries or souvenirs; they are functional artifacts, markers of identity, and carriers of memory.</p>
            <p>Most of the cloth used in rural households — whether printed, tied, dyed, or embroidered — is made by local artisans using skills passed down for generations. These crafts evolved not for export but for daily living in an arid desert environment, with its unique climatic, social, and cultural demands. This webpage uncovers the world of ordinary textiles — the ones that rarely appear in tourist brochures but define the lives of millions.</p>

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>Textile traditions in Rajasthan date back centuries, shaped by the region’s geography and history. The desert climate demanded fabrics that were both durable and comfortable, leading to innovations in weaving, dyeing, and embroidery. Communities such as the Meghwal, Rabari, and Bhil developed distinct styles, each reflecting their environment and way of life. Textiles were not just utilitarian; they were deeply embedded in rituals, festivals, and social customs.</p>

            <h2>Everyday Textile Types</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ghagra & Odhni:</strong> Everyday skirts and veils worn by women, often made from locally woven cotton or wool.</li>

            <h2>Techniques & Processes</h2>
            <p>Rajasthan’s textile crafts are renowned for their diversity of techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block Printing:</strong> Using hand-carved wooden blocks to stamp intricate patterns onto fabric, often with natural dyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Bandhani (Tie-Dye):</strong> Tying small sections of cloth and dyeing them to create dotted patterns, a skill passed down through generations.</li>

            <h2>Role in Home-Life</h2>
            <p>Textiles in Rajasthan’s homes serve many purposes beyond clothing. Quilts and rugs provide warmth during cold desert nights. Decorative hangings mark festive occasions and family milestones. Everyday garments are tailored for comfort and practicality, reflecting the wearer’s age, status, and community. Textiles are also central to rituals — from birth to marriage to religious ceremonies, each event is marked by special cloths and garments.</p>

            <h2>Artisan Stories</h2>
            <p>Behind every textile is an artisan whose skills are honed over years of practice. In villages, women gather to stitch quilts and embroider garments, sharing stories and songs as they work. Men may operate handlooms or carve printing blocks. These crafts are often a family affair, with knowledge passed from elders to children. Despite modern challenges, many artisans remain committed to their traditions, finding pride and purpose in their work.</p>

            <h2>Preservation & Challenges</h2>
            <p>While Rajasthan’s textile heritage is rich, it faces threats from mass production, changing lifestyles, and declining artisan numbers. Efforts are underway to preserve these crafts through cooperatives, government initiatives, and NGOs. Supporting local artisans by choosing handmade textiles helps sustain these traditions and the communities that depend on them.</p>
